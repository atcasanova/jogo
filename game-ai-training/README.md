# Game AI Training System

This directory contains the Python training scripts and utilities used to train bots for the board game.

## JSON Logging

Set the environment variable `JSON_LOGGING=1` before running the training scripts to output logs in machine readable JSON format. When enabled, each log message is emitted as a single JSON object on a separate line. Without this variable the logs remain human friendly text.
